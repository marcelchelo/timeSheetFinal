                    <p> I'm a subcontractor, working at different sites. Therefore I'm not at every jobsite. 
                        so I trust my workers arrive and leave on time. We do have a sign in sheet after all.     
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Typically in NYC we start at 7am and leave at 3:30pm . And we all know workers arrive on time, and trust they leave on time.
